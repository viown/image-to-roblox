Convert real image files into roblox scripts!

With this tool, you can convert any real image you have on your computer into a script that can load the image through a roblox game.

It converts an image into roblox frames, treating every pixel in the image as a roblox frame.

How to use:
1. Place the image you want to convert in the images folder (supported formats: .png, .jpg, .bmp)
2. Run console.py
3. Choose a name, it can be anything
4. Input the name of the image, make sure to specify the format in the end (example: image.png)
5. Wait a few seconds, it can take a bit to convert.
6. After it's done, your script will be in the scripts folder

To test this out, open roblox studio, create a localscript and place it in ReplicatedFirst or StarterGui, paste the code in the script then click play!
